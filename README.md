# SoftwareRendering

A software renderer that emulates a rudimentary rendering pipeline. The matrix/vector math and rasterization is written from scratch to help understand fundamental 3d graphics concepts.
The exercise was to render a simple 3D scene using only a putpixel interface to a framebuffer.

Only .obj files can be loaded. Rendering is slow and nowhere near optimal. The code is far from clean.

Below is a fun gif of the scan-line rasterization process in the original Doom level: E1M1.
